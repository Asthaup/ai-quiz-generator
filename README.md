üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

API Key Security: The OpenRouter API key in script.js is currently set to a placeholder (YOUR_API_KEY). If you‚Äôve added your actual API key for local testing, do not push it to a public repository or host the app on a public server (e.g., GitHub Pages) without securing it. Consider using environment variables or a backend proxy for production deployment.
Regenerate API Key: If you‚Äôve exposed your API key, reset it at https://openrouter.ai/keys and update script.js with the new key for local use.
