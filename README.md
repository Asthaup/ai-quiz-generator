üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Follow these steps to set up the AI Quiz Generator locally on your machine:

Clone or Download the Repository:

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Asthaup/ai-quiz-generator.git
cd ai-quiz-generator


Alternatively, download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extract it.


Obtain an OpenRouter API Key:

Sign up or log in at OpenRouter.
Go to https://openrouter.ai/keys and generate a new API key.
Copy the API key (e.g., sk-or-v1-...).


Configure the API Key:

Open script.js in a text editor (e.g., VS Code, Notepad).
Locate the line:"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",


Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenRouter API key.
Save the file.


Run the Application:

Double-click index.html to open it in a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome), or drag the file into your browser.
Important: The app must be run locally to keep the API key secure. Do not host script.js with your API key on a public server (e.g., GitHub Pages) without securing it first.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

API Key Security: The OpenRouter API key in script.js is currently set to a placeholder (YOUR_API_KEY). If you‚Äôve added your actual API key for local testing, do not push it to a public repository or host the app on a public server (e.g., GitHub Pages) without securing it. Consider using environment variables or a backend proxy for production deployment.
Regenerate API Key: If you‚Äôve exposed your API key, reset it at https://openrouter.ai/keys and update script.js with the new key for local use.
